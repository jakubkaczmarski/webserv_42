Are we allowed to use 'using'

need to figure out how to parse the body

Content-Length: number-of-bytes - Used by POST request, to inform the server the length of the request body.
Content-Type: mime-type - Used by POST request, to inform the server the media type of the request body.

/////////////// Subject - Set a default file to answer if the request is a directory
Suppose that a directory called "testdir" is present in the document base directory "htdocs".
If a client issues a GET request to "/testdir/" (i.e., at the directory).

    The server will return "/testdir/index.html" if the directory contains a "index.html" file.
    Otherwise, the server returns the directory listing, if directory listing is enabled in the server configuration.
    Otherwise, the server returns "404 Page Not Found".
///////////////


////
The server uses a MIME configuration file (called "conf\mime.types") to map the file extension to a media type,
so that it can ascertain the media type of the file by looking at its file extension.
For example, file extensions ".htm", ".html" are associated with MIME media type "text/html",
file extension of ".jpg", ".jpeg" are associated with "image/jpeg". When a file is returned to the client,
the server has to put up a Content-Type response header to inform the client the media type of the data.

//
No whitespace is allowed between the header field-name and colon.  In
   the past, differences in the handling of such whitespace have led to
   security vulnerabilities in request routing and response handling.  A
   server MUST reject any received request message that contains
   whitespace between a header field-name and colon with a response code
   of 400 (Bad Request).

CGI stuffs:
The Query_String and Method Get
The query string is the simplest method of passing form data to a script.
If you append a question mark (?) to the url of your script,
then any characters after the question mark will be passed
to your script in the environment variable called QUERY_STRING. 

CHECK FOR MORE THAN ONE ? IN QUERY STRING

Pass things as reference whenever possible
